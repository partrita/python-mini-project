Welcome to the Minion Game!

**Game Rules:**
1. Both players are given the same string (a single, capital word without spaces).
2. Both players create substrings using letters from this string.
3. Stuart makes words starting with **consonants**.
4. Kevin makes words starting with **vowels**.
5. The game ends when all possible substrings have been considered.

A player gets +1 point for each **occurrence** of a valid substring in the original string.
